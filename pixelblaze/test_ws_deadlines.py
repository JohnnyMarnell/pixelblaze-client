"""A chatty board must not be able to hang a receive.

Every Pixelblaze pushes `{"fps":...}` stats frames nobody asked for, about once
a second. `wsReceive` reads them, keeps none of them, and loops -- and its only
way out is the socket timeout, which a stats frame resets every time it lands.
So on hardware "how long until this gives up" is a race against the push
interval rather than a deadline, and the loop that waits for an output expander
a board hasn't got depends on losing that race to terminate at all.

These tests hold a fake board that always wins it, so the failure is a hang
every time instead of once an hour on a WiFi AP.
